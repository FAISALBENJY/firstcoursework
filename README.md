The following describes the differences between kotlina and java of android;
Kotlin combines features of both object-oriented and functional programming, whereas Java is limited to object-oriented programming.
Kotlin allows users to create an extension function while Java doesn't offer any extension functions.
Kotlin doesn't offer implicit conversions, and Java supports implicit conversions.
Kotlin combines features of both object-oriented and functional programming, whereas Java is limited to object-oriented programming.
There are no null variables or objects in Kotlin on the other hand, Null variable or objects are part of Java language.
Kotlin doesn't support static members, while Java uses static members.
In, Kotlin variables of a primitive type are objects while in Java Variables of a primitive type aren't objects
Kotlin supports Lambda Expression whereas Java doesn't support Lambda expression.
Kotlin doesn't require any variable datatype specifications while Java requires variable datatype specifications.
Kotlin programs don't require semicolons in their program while Java program does need a semicolon.
Language scripting capabilities allow you to use Kotlin directly in your Gradle build scripts while Java does not offer language scripting capabilities.
Kotlin allows users to create an extension function while Java doesn't offer any extension functions.
Kotlin doesn't require too much work for data classes while Java developers write and construct a lot of elements to develop classes
Kotlin doesn't offer implicit conversions while Java supports implicit conversions.

In kotlin Variables of a primitive type are objects	while in java Variables of a primitive type aren't objects
In Kotlin, we can have one or more secondary constructors while	In Java, we can't have secondary constructors. However, it can have multiple constructors.
Kotlin string template also supports expression while Java string doesn't support expression like Kotlin.
It's quite easier to deploy Kotlin code while It is hard to deploy Java code.
Kotlin programs don't require semicolons in their program while Java program does need a semicolon.
In Kotlin, coroutine are concurrency design pattern which can be used to simplify code while Java uses two coroutine options as 1) Rx Java and 2) Project loom.
Kotlin doesn't have any wildcard-types while Wide-card is available in Java.
Kotlin's type of system has inbuilt null safety while NullPonter Exception is mainly responsible for the development of Java and Android.
Smart cast feature is available in Kotlin while Smart cast feature in not available in Java.
Kotlin doesn't require any variable datatype specifications while	Java requires variable datatype specification
